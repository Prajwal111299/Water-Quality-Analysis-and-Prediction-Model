# Water-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction-Model
Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings. From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights. Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning. One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the analysis of water quality. It is also known as water potability analysis because our task here is to understand all the factors that affect water potability and train a machine learning model that can classify whether a specific water sample is safe or unfit for consumption.  For the water quality analysis task, I will be using a Kaggle dataset that contains data on all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. All of the factors that affect water quality are very important, so we need to briefly explore each feature of this dataset before training a machine learning model to predict whether a water sample is safe or unsuitable for consumption.
conclusion :- The above results are looking satisfactory.
